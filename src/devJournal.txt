// goal 12/17/25: detect user input, shoot bubble across the box

  // bend the ball if it hits the left or the right wall.
  // reset when the ball hits the top wall.

// detect balls that are connected
// detect balls that are connected and has the same color
// pop them
// unconnected ball with the same color popped

attach first, then detect matching bubbles. it may collide with another bubble, and attach to a bubble with a matching color.
