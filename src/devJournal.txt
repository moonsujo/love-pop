(slide embarrassing photo from the top)
save the letter until all bubbles are popped
when all main bubbles are popped, display 'pop them all for a surprise...'

goal: add more photos
new balls should not have hearts

goal: show photo on popping the original bubbles
31 - 8 x 4.

goal: write a letter
unfold in the box

goal: pick the balls based on colors remaining
if there's two of the same color remaining, and the next two are the same color,
and you pop them, you'll have to make another group.

// goal: design the first level to ensure you can pop the first two.
// heart shape
// assign colors (figma)
// first bubble must have a color that can be popped in the last row.
// cleared stage!

// goal: picking the next ball's color
// initialize a ball with a color that exists in the level.
