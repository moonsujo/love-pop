// goal 12/17/25: detect user input, shoot bubble across the box
// goal: display arrow. move it with keys.
  // should stop at 60 degrees left and right.
  // shoot the ball according to the direction.
  // arrow should stay after shot.
  // bend the ball if it hits the left or the right wall.
  // reset when the ball hits the top wall.
  // reset when the ball hits another ball.
// goal: optimize geometry
// goal: organize balls into a data structure

// goal: detect when ball hits another ball // frame rate did not drop.
// detect balls that are connected
// detect balls that are connected and has the same color
// pop them
// unconnected ball with the same color popped
// can't shoot after popping one
// attach first, then detect matching bubbles. it may collide with another bubble, and attach to a bubble with a matching color.
// group pops with 2 of the same
// ball doesn't stick to the left - on row 4, index 1
// ball doesn't pop even when group is the same sometimes
// detect which side of the ball it hit - divided by 6 sides
// add ball to the store
// drop the ones that are not connected anymore

// goal: add a 'shadow' row at the top
// ball should add to the row and stick like it's in a regular row
// set all balls within box. 

// not all photos are displaying on game finish
// goal: check win state
// if all balls cleared, win
// design ball
// when all main bubbles are popped, display 'pop them all for a surprise...'
// button becomes clickable
// implement background
// write letter
// scroll from top of the box
// if ball below threshold, lose - reset
// mark balls with photos with hearts
// when all photos display, display 'button'
// don't let it be clickable until all bubbles are popped

// bubble attached to top right at the top
// bubble attaches to left at the bottom at row 16
// stage falls for two reasons
// 1. makes it easier to pop remaining bubbles on top
// 2. lose condition
// push top and bubbles down

// randomly assign photos to bubbles
// 31 / 46 have photos

// goal: add more photos
// new balls should not have hearts

// 31 - 8 x 4.

// goal: pick the balls based on colors remaining
// if there's two of the same color remaining, and the next two are the same color,
// and you pop them, you'll have to make another group.

// goal: design the first level to ensure you can pop the first two.
// heart shape
// assign colors (figma)
// first bubble must have a color that can be popped in the last row.
// cleared stage!

// goal: picking the next ball's color
// initialize a ball with a color that exists in the level.
// the next one also needs to be one that's in the level.

// goal: close the gap between the rows

// goal: request materials - cgtrader.com
// bow tie on the top


level 2: more bubbles, more colors, less turns to drop
different shapes. different photos.

option: make balls move at the same speed across different browsers
option: smoothly move the ball upon stick
// option: lower stage after x turns
//  (slide embarrassing photo from the top)
//  it was too much. it breaks the lovely vibe.
// option: animate background
balls
// snow
