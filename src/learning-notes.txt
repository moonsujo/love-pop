Redux: 
calculate state with hook. set state with reducer.
example: attachBubbleLocation, attachBubble.
you can have a reducer that doesn't take in any payload.

react:
new Array(num_length).fill(null)
without .fill, it will have 'empty' which is inaccessible.
example: adding a new row of bubbles

BFS:
can be written with a queue and a while loop
initialize queue with a ball.
add adjacent balls to the queue.
shift from the front. the order becomes: 1 - all balls around it - all balls around the second one
track the visited ones. data structure: set, elements: string of "row-column"
you can use this to revisit the bubbles and remove ones that aren't visited from the [row][column]
